## Welcome to R Tutorial for ATS Group 

### Welcome!
This is the homepage for "Quick R tutorial session with CY" held every Tuesday for the ATS team. Please find the google calendar event here if you would like to join remotely.

### Distribution
This repository is for share within the ATS team only; it will be made private after my expense request for Github's pro version gets approved.

### Summary
A series of R tutorial sessions where we can get started on learning to manage, transform, and visualize testing data using the R programming language. 

Objectives: (Less pasting and formatting with Prism!)..... but also organize messy data, transform it in ways that address our questions, and communicate results in a variety of formats. 

(I am not an expert but.....) please let me know if there's any specific areas you are interested in or any specific questions/aspects you want to address, so we can change the focus as we go on, to make this session more practical :)


### Schedule
Tentative schedule of the content we will discuss in the first several sessions; let me know what you would want to see.
Sept. 9th: Setting up + [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/ats-master/r_tutorial/blob/master/Notes/Tutorial%201.1.Rmd)
